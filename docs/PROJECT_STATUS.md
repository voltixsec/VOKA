## Sprint 09B - Quotation Workspace

Status: Approved - In Progress

Approved scope:

1. Refresh the official Sprint 09A close point and Sprint 09B charter.
2. Build a bilingual, RTL-ready quotation list with search, filters, pagination,
   and complete loading/empty/error states.
3. Build quotation details with role- and state-aware lifecycle actions.
4. Build quotation creation and draft editing over the canonical Quotation API.
5. Add UI/integration coverage and GitHub Actions quality checks.

Out of scope:

- PDF/document generation, email, WhatsApp, Sales Order, Invoice, Payments,
  full Voice/AI execution, Import/Export Center, and unnecessary Prisma changes.

Architecture:

- Clean Architecture
- DDD
- Prisma
- PostgreSQL
- Canonical quotation implementation under `src/`; do not duplicate it under
  `features/`.

## Architecture Decisions

- AI First: `APPROVED`
- Advanced Import / Export Center: `APPROVED` as an optional product capability
- Codex Desktop development execution workflow: `APPROVED`

The Advanced Import / Export Center remains `PLANNED` and is sequenced after the
Core Sales Engine.
